<br><br>
Single-Source Shortest Path Problem - The problem of finding shortest paths from a source vertex v to all other vertices in the graph.
<br>
Applications:- <br>
- Maps (Map Quest, Google Maps) <br>
- Routing Systems
<br>
Dijkstra's algorithm - is a solution to the single-source shortest path problem in graph theory. 
 <br>
Works on both directed and undirected graphs. However, all edges must have nonnegative weights.

Feel free to *fork* and improve my implementation to more efficient one ;).
